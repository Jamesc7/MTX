# Methotrexate VR Project - Dr. Roy Bergstrom (University of Rhode Island), Dr. Bongsup Cho (University of Rhode Island)

Methotrexate (MTX) is a small organic molecule to treat cancer (breast,
leukemia, lymphoma) and autoimmune diseases (psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis,
and Crohn’s diseases). MTX’s anticancer action is due to its inhibitory activity against the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Inhibition of DHFR leads to partial depletion of the coenzyme tetrahydrofolic acid (THFA) required for the synthesis of Thymine, a crucial building block of DNA. MTX binds to DHFR 1,000 times more tightly than folate, blocking the action of DHFR.

We propose to create VR files that (1) compare/contrast binding of the natural folic acid and MTX; (2) show the close proximity between the nicotine ring of the cofactor NADPH and the heterocyclic ring of the natural folic acid and the opposite situation for MTX (this explains the inhibitory action of MTX); (3) the structural basis of MTX resistance based on steric constraints in the active site.

This project requires manipulation of MTX structures and active ligand binding
using Chimera X software and creation of the corresponding VR files.
The students will learn the importance of active site binding and geometry for
enzyme efficiency, drug action, and drug resistance.
